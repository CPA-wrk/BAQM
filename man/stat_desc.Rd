\title{Summary Descriptive Statistics for List or Data Frame}
\usage{
stat_desc(data, opts = list(digits = 4, scipen = 8), pad = 2, t.rpt = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector, list or data frame containing variables to summarize. A vector is treated as a single variable data frame. Unnamed variables receive generic names like \code{V1}, \code{V2}, etc.}

\item{opts}{A key=value tupe list, optional input for "\code{options}" values on output. Existing values are restored on exit.}

\item{pad}{A positive integer for the number of spaces between output columns..}

\item{t.rpt}{A logical concerning report format. By default the summary printed and returned is organized to show variables in columns and their statistic values in rows. Setting \code{t.rpt = TRUE} generates a transposed report with variables in rows and statistics in columns.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of summary tables for counts, numeric, and factor variables.
}
\description{
Computes and prints summary descriptive statistics for each variable in a list or  data frame, including counts, numeric summaries (min, quartiles, mean, max, standard deviation), and factor summaries (levels and frequencies).
}
\details{
For each variable in \code{data}, the function computes the count of non-missing and missing values. Numeric variables are summarized by minimum, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile, maximum, and standard deviation. Factor and character variables are summarized by level frequencies. Results are formatted in a table and printed. The function returns a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{cnt}: Counts for each variable (\code{n.val}, \code{n.na})
  \item \code{num}: Numeric summaries for numeric variables
  \item \code{fctr}: Summaries for factor variables
  \item \code{rpt}: The formatted summary table (printed)
}
}
\examples{
stat_desc(mtcars)
stat_desc(data.frame(a = rnorm(100), b = sample(letters[1:3], 100, TRUE)))
}
